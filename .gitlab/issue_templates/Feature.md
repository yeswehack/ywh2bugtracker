>  Risk level MUST be systematically assessed before designing a change. Actions to handle risk and approval depend on the risk level:
>- None/low : no or low impact and probability considered. If the risk is considered low, actions to handle the risk may be defined. No approval required.
>- Medium : either significant impact or significant probability considered. Actions must be defined in the sections below and approved/completed by a team lead before implementing the change.
>- High : significant impact AND probability considered. Actions must be defined in the section below and approved/completed by CTO or CISO before implementing the change.
